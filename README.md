## 1. Architecture Background
- Unlike legacy infrastructures that rely heavily  on mapping blocks(e.g , SSIS) which might crash when headers change  or exceed character limits, this system utilizes a code-first pipeline:
**1. Bronze(Raw Landing Layer):** Using Python to ingest wide matrix-column csv files into SQL server database(Landing Zone)(Extract-Load)
**2. Silver(Staging Layer):** Horizontally unpivoted  the raw data using  dynamic SQL (CROSS APPLY VALUES) , Transfomed and inserted into the Permanent Staging Table.(Load - Transform)
  **3. Gold(Analytical Layer):** Finally ingested the data from the permanent staging table into an organised dimensional Star schema with historical tracking(SCD-2), using a virtual presenation Layer(rpt).
